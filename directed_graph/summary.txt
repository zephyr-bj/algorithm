graph traversal:
edge lists are represented by map from "src" to "dst"
visited recording could be array or map using the "dst" as key. 
    for the course schedule problem, visiting recording is vector of number;
    for the itinerary problem, visiting recording is map from "src to dst" pair to "visiting times"
