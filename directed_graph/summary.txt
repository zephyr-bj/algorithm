dsf
clone graph (edge list, pointer to nodes represents visited)
reconstruct itinerary (edge list, integer represents visited)
longest increasing integer path in matrix (matrix)
word search II (matrix)
number of isolated islands in matrix (matrix)
word break II
surrounded regions in matrix(matrix)
word search (matrix)

bsf
course schedule (edge list, integer represents visited)
course schedule II (edge list, integer represents visted)

graph traversal:
edge lists are represented by map from "src" to "dst"
visited recording could be array or map using the "dst" as key. 
    for the course schedule problem, visiting recording is vector of number;
    for the itinerary problem, visiting recording is map from "src to dst" pair to "visiting times"
