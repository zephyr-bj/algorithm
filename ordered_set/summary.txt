data stream as disjoint intervals
count the ranges, whose element sum is within [lb, ub]
find the longest Increasing sequence (0300) (0352)
design a structure, maintain the median of a data stream

lower_bound
upper_bound 
define a set with customized compare, say a stuct my_cmp, it should define a "operator ()"
    set<T,my_cmp>bin;
    set<int, greator<int>>bin;
