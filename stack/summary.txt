increasing/decreasing stack
1. stack automatically maintain the position/time order
2. inc/dec stack also maintain a value order
sliding window maximum, check position/time to decide pop (0239)
min stack,check value to decide pop (0155)
largest rectangle histogram, check value to pop (0084)

modeled as a stack
simplify directery path (0071)
longest valid parentheses, use a helper stack called level_sum (0032)
is valid parentheses (0020)

stack tricks
implement a stack by queues (0225)
